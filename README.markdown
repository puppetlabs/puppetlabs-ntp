##Overview

The NTP module installs, configures, and manages the ntp service.

##Module Description

The NTP module handles running NTP across a range of operating systems and
distributions.  Where possible we use the upstream ntp templates so that the
results closely match what you'd get if you modified the package default conf
files.

##Setup

###What ntp affects

* ntp package.
* ntp configuration file.
* ntp service.

###Beginning with ntp

include '::ntp' is enough to get you up and running.  If you wish to pass in
parameters like which servers to use then you can use:

```puppet
class { '::ntp':
  servers => [ 'ntp1.corp.com', 'ntp2.corp.com' ],
}
```

##Usage

All interaction with the ntp module can do be done through the main ntp class.
This means you can simply toggle the options in the ntp class to get at the
full functionality.

###I just want NTP, what's the minimum I need?

```puppet
include '::ntp'
```

###I just want to tweak the servers, nothing else.

```puppet
class { '::ntp':
  servers => [ 'ntp1.corp.com', 'ntp2.corp.com' ],
}
```

###I'd like to make sure I restrict who can connect as well.

```puppet
class { '::ntp':
  servers  => [ 'ntp1.corp.com', 'ntp2.corp.com' ],
  restrict => ['127.0.0.1'],
}
```

###I'd like to opt out of having the service controlled, we use another tool for that.

```puppet
class { '::ntp':
  servers        => [ 'ntp1.corp.com', 'ntp2.corp.com' ],
  restrict       => ['127.0.0.1'],
  manage_service => false,
}
```

###Looks great!  But I'd like a different template, we need to do something unique here.

```puppet
class { '::ntp':
  servers         => [ 'ntp1.corp.com', 'ntp2.corp.com' ],
  restrict        => ['127.0.0.1'],
  manage_service  => false,
  config_template => 'different/module/custom.template.erb',
}
```

##Reference

###Classes

* ntp: Main class, includes all the rest.
* ntp::install: Handles the packages.
* ntp::config: Handles the configuration file.
* ntp::service: Handles the service.

###Parameters

The following parameters are available in the ntp module

####`autoupdate`

Deprecated: This parameter previously determined if the ntp module should be
automatically updated to the latest version available.  Replaced by package\_
ensure.

####`config`

This sets the file to write ntp configuration into.

####`config_template`

This determines which template puppet should use for the ntp configuration.

####`driftfile`

This sets the location of the driftfile for ntp.

####`keys_controlkey`

Which of the keys is used as the control key.

####`keys_enable`

Should the ntp keys functionality be enabled.

####`keys_file`

Location of the keys file.

####`keys_requestkey`

Which of the keys is used as the request key.

####`package_ensure`

This can be set to 'present' or 'latest' or a specific version to choose the
ntp package to be installed.

####`package_name`

This determines the name of the package to install.

####`panic`

This determines if ntp should 'panic' in the event of a very large clock skew.
We set this to false if you're on a virtual machine by default as they don't
do a great job with keeping time.

####`preferred_servers`

List of ntp servers to prefer.  Will append prefer for any server in this list
that also appears in the servers list.

####`restrict`

This sets the restrict options in the ntp configuration.  The lines are
preappended with restrict so you just need to list the rest of the restriction.

####`servers`

This selects the servers to use for ntp peers.

####`service_enable`

This determines if the service should be enabled at boot.

####`service_ensure`

This determines if the service should be running or not.

####`service_manage`

This selects if puppet should manage the service in the first place.

####`service_name`

This selects the name of the ntp service for puppet to manage.

####`udlc`

Enables configs for undisciplined local clock regardless of
status as a virtual machine. 


##Limitations

This module has been built on and tested against Puppet 2.7 and higher.

The module has been tested on:

* RedHat Enterprise Linux 5/6
* Debian 6/7
* CentOS 5/6
* Ubuntu 12.04
* Gentoo
* Arch Linux
* FreeBSD

Testing on other platforms has been light and cannot be guaranteed. 

##Development

Puppet Labs modules on the Puppet Forge are open projects, and community
contributions are essential for keeping them great. We canâ€™t access the
huge number of platforms and myriad of hardware, software, and deployment
configurations that Puppet is intended to serve.

We want to keep it as easy as possible to contribute changes so that our
modules work in your environment. There are a few guidelines that we need
contributors to follow so that we can have a chance of keeping on top of things.

You can read the complete module contribution guide [on the Puppet Labs wiki.](http://projects.puppetlabs.com/projects/module-site/wiki/Module_contributing)
