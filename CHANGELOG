2013-07-31 - Version 2.0.0

Summary:

The 2.0 release focuses on merging all the distro specific
templates into a single reusable template across all platforms.

To aid in that goal we now allow you to change the driftfile,
ntp keys, and perferred_servers.

Backwards-incompatible changes:

As all the distro specific templates have been removed and a
unified one created you may be missing functionality you
previously relied on.  Please test carefully before rolling
out globally.

Configuration directives that might possibly be affected:
- `filegen`
- `fudge` (for virtual machines)
- `keys`
- `logfile`
- `restrict`
- `restrictkey`
- `statistics`
- `trustedkey`

Features:
- All templates merged into a single template.
- NTP Keys support added.
- Add preferred servers support.
- Parameters in `ntp` class:
 - `driftfile`: path for the ntp driftfile.
 - `keys_enable`: Enable NTP keys feature.
 - `keys_file`: Path for the NTP keys file.
 - `keys_trusted`: Which keys to trust.
 - `keys_controlkey`: Which key to use for the control key.
 - `keys_requestkey`: Which key to use for the request key.
